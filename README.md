# streamkata

A code kata to practise Java 8 functional programming with streams

### Your mission ###

This kata lets you experiment with Streams and functional programming in Java 8.

The exercise is based around two interfaces:

* MessageAnalyser
* DecryptingAnalyser

These can be used to find words and phrases in a plain text file or an encrypted file

Two working but awful implementations are provided, along with tests
The tests take longer to run than they should, you should be able to do better with streams.

Your mission is to complete the Stream-based implementations, using as much cool stuff from JDK 8 as you feel you can justify.
